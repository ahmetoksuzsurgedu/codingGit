Error events#
When an error occurs within an EventEmitter instance, the 
typical action is for an 'error' event to be emitted. These 
are treated as special cases within Node.js.

If an EventEmitter does not have at least one 
listener registered for the 'error' event, and an 'error' 
event is emitted, the error is thrown, a stack trace is printed, 
and the Node.js process exits.

const myEmitter = new MyEmitter();
myEmitter.emit('error', new Error('whoops!'));
// Throws and crashes Node.jsHello Nefise!!!Hello Nefise!!!Hello Nefise!!!
